# Face-Recognition-based-Authentication-System-For-Data-Centre
Maintaining security in an organization specifically in the workplaces like examination 
hall in the education sector, lockers room in banking places, server room or control room 
of an organization, is the dominant thing and keeping the environment free of 
wrongdoing. 
One of them is the data-center, the data center is basically a physical facility that 
organizations use to house their critical applications and data. It holds proprietary and 
sensitive information such as intellectual property, customer data, and financial records, 
and therefore needs to be both physically and digitally secure. Traditional ways are failing 
to tackle modern challenges of efficiency, security. There is an immense need for reform 
and leading technology to protect several areas from unauthorized users. 
Authentication may be defined as “providing the right person with the right privileges 
the right access at the right time.” In general, there are three approaches to 
authentication. In order of least secure and least convenient to most secure and most 
convenient, they are Something you have - card, token, key. Something you know- PIN, 
password. Something you are- a biometric. 
The most common person authentication methods are passwords, PINs, smart keys, 
smart cards, but have limitations and vulnerabilities. For instance, passwords and PINs 
can be easily forgotten, hard to remember, or stolen. Smart keys can be easily lost or 
duplicated. Smart cards with magnetic strips can be forged. But a person’s biometrics or 
biological traits cannot be stolen, forgotten, or misplaced. As a result, they provide a much 
more secure and reliable way to authenticate an individual when compared to the 
traditional methods. 
Biometrics is the measurement and statistical analysis of people's unique physical and 
behavioral characteristics. The term biometrics is derived from the Greek word bio, 
meaning life, and metric, meaning to measure. Every human being possesses certain 
unique features in terms of both physical and behavioral characteristics that are different 
from everybody else on the planet. Based on that several types of biometric exist like 
Fingerprint, voice recognition, facial recognition, iris recognition, retina scan, etc.
